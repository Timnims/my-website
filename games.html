        <p> Over the years I have created many projects! Some my computer science teacher graded, others were fun side projects to test my skills.
          my most notible ones utilize the graphic user interface program called pyFLTK (python Fast Light Took Kit). pyFLTK is the python variant of the C++ FLTK.
          Essentially they do the exact same thing but are coded in different languages. It is designed for simple buttons and quick GUIs and not very sutible for 
          games with animation. Nevertheless I took on the challenege of creating some simple animation games such as snake. This was a project on my own which
          I did to get even more comfortable with the library that is FLTK.

        <p> In my second year of programing, my teacher enlightened us with the world of recursion. Recursion is a more advanced method usually taught in university. However, our teacher taught
          us simple recursion regardless. Find below two recursive fractals: Sierpinski's Triangle and Carpet. Recursion in its simplest form a type of loop and so each loop you do is a smaller iteration
          of each shape creating these wild designs.

        <p>Other projects I have worked on in class are a simple MP3 player with all sorts of buttons and features such as next song, previous song, file display and many more.
          As well as other simples games such as minesweeper all still using pyFLTK!

        <p>My most challenging and most proud project is my pyFLTK Tetris project. Creating a fully functioning game with sounds proved to be quite the challenege, yet I presisted
          creating Tetris from scratch. I still plan to create many more projects to continue practicing my problem solving skills and futher enhance my ability to think like a developer.
